Greetings, Members of the Parliament and welcome to the 4th Lok Sabha Session of DSMUN, 2018!

India has often found itself at crossroads when it comes to matters pertaining to religion. More often than not, religion has been the impediment in the social and the economic progress of our nation. This year, the Sabha will discuss an issue that strikes at the core of this debate between religion and social moderation and progress: Uniform Civil Code.

Being an issue that has been debated at various forums around the country in the past year alone, the ministers are expected to bring relevant arguments, and effective policies, backed with logic and evidence to the committee. That being said, it is equally important for the ministers to demonstrate collaborative and persuasive skills in order to reach a consensus on this contentious issue. Moreover, they are also expected to amicably solve disputes and quarrels, while maintaining an ethical code of conduct that is expected of a true parliamentarian.

As for me, I currently pursue the IBDP curriculum in School, with a keen interest in History and Politics. Outside the classroom, I have been involved in debating quizzing, and acting. I have also taken part in MUN conferences, over a span of four years, in different capacities. In addition to this, I enjoy reading and writing on current affairs, and am an editor of few school-based publications.

Best of luck and hope to see you soon in Chandbagh!
