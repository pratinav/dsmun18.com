Greetings Delegates!

It is a pleasure for me to introduce myself as the Chairperson of the British East India Companyâ€™s India Council for DSMUN 2018.

Organizing a committee like this has been in the works for a while. As it is, after all, a crisis committee, you may perhaps want to be open to the possibility of quite a different experience from most MUNs, especially considering that the India Council is based entirely in a historical setting, specifically the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857.

Thorough background research will be required as the circumstances that delegates will be operating in may diverge from actual historical events. For this reason, understanding your portfolio with its leanings and connections will aid you more than research about historical events. Priority should be given to critical thinking and immediate resolution of issues. The committee will be very dynamic and do not expect (for neither do we) to know where the committee will be headed.

As for myself, I enjoy a limited range of pursuits including reading, debating and writing. Personally, I never anticipated reliving the most hated chapter of the ICSE history curriculum.

The primary agenda will be resolving the 1857 mutiny and containing its outbreak. As subjects of Her Majesty the Queen and high-ranking persons working for the advancement of the British Empire, making sure that India remains not only a British colony but also a constant source of raw materials and wealth is our utmost priority.

Long Live the Queen!

Regards,<br>
Armaan Verma (As Lord Canning, the Governor-General of British India)
