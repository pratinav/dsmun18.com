Hello Delegates,

As the chairperson of the Disarmament and International Security Committee, it gives me great pleasure in welcoming all of you to The Doon School Model United Nations Conference, 2018.

Disarmament and International Security, colloquially 'DISEC', is the first committee of the UN General Assembly. It forms the kernel of the security spectrum of the UN; more comprehensively, it urges member nations to collaborate and work coherently to remove all threats on international peace and security. The committee, in general, requires out of the box yet pragmatic thinking, and this is exactly what I expect all delegates to bring to the table this year.

Originally, the NPT was conceived for only 25 years; however, it was extended indefinitely in May 1995. Over the years the NPT has come to be seen by many Third World states as "a conspiracy of the nuclear 'haves' to keep the nuclear 'have-nots' in their place”. This argument has its roots in Article VI of the treaty which "obligates the nuclear weapons states to liquidate their nuclear stockpiles and pursue complete disarmament"—the non-nuclear states see no signs of this happening, and the treaty has often come under scrutiny as an ineffective document. Therefore, it is the DISEC’s prerogative to step forward and suggest amendments to resolve this issue.

As for myself, I have taken the risk of pursuing the IBDP curriculum, and am currently in the SC Form (Class 12). In School, I am actively involved in basketball, social service, quizzing, MUNs and am an editor in various School publications. I am also a School Prefect and the House Captain of Jaipur House. In my spare time (if I have any) I watch numerous movies and TV shows and keep up with the latest music, but none of it from Bollywood.

Lastly, I expect a high level of debate in committee but you will find that I find the creation of memories much more important!

Best,<br>
Aayush Chowdhry
