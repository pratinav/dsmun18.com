Hello delegates,

As the chairperson of the Special Convention on Religion and Terror, it gives me great pleasure in inviting you to the 12th Doon School Model United Nations.

Sexual assault cases are on the rise today, and many movements have sprung up as a result. However, our international legal framework still lacks a clause that directly addresses this prevalent issue. Moreover, sexual abuse has very close ties with the socio-religious structure of many countries. Therefore, it the prerogative of SCRT to form a ‘sexual abuse’ clause that will help put an end to the sexual assault cases. This will include male, female, transgender, and other types of sexes as well. Not only will member states have to accept or deny the existence of these genders, but they will also have to accept a common definition of sexual abuse in today’s world.

The second agenda is aimed at addressing a question that has begun to puzzle everybody today—the requirements of religious leaders in modern-day society. This is in view of the many terrorist activities (and wars) that are being waged in the name of religion. Hezbollah, Hamas, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and the Taliban all began as religious groups dedicated to piety and charity. Yet, once they turned to violence, they became horribly potent, executing campaigns of terrorism deadlier than those of their secular rivals. The religious authorities have been called to present their opinions on the topic, and offer a solution to the problem.

Having been a chairperson at DSMUN last year, I expect the delegates to be active in the committee with the same level of enthusiasm. While a constructive debate will be my primary focus, I would also like to see delegates negotiate with each other, and formulate solutions that address these issues.

As for myself, I am an SC Form student (Class 12) studying the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. Having a fervent interest in international relations, I serve on the Editorial Board of The School Weekly. All delegates are welcome to contact my Deputy Chairpersons Amol Singh, Pranav Goel, or myself if any particular assistance is required. 

I hope you enjoy your time at Chandbagh and look forward to meeting the delegates come August. 

Regards,<br>
Zoraver Mehta
