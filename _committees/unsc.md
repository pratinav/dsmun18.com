Dear Delegates,

As the Chairperson of the United Nations Security Council I would like to extend a warm welcome to all delegates to DSMUN â€™18. I am in Grade 12, and am currently pursuing the IB Diploma with my favourite subjects including English, Economics and History. My key interests are debating, reading, writing and expectedly, Model UN. I have attended and won at various national and international MUNs and had the privilege to chair the United Nations Women Committee last DSMUN. I am a passionate debater and love having discussions with people on nearly every topic under the sun, constantly searching for lively debate.

Failed states have been an issue the UN has been trying to tackle since its inception. Drowned in political infighting, corruption and economic depression, failed states have often become breeding grounds for human rights abuses and terrorist organizations. To tackle this issue the first agenda up for discussion is to construct a framework for dealing with failed states. The second issue we will discuss is cyberwarfare. States and non-state actors are increasingly engaging in cyberwarfare to extract information and obtain strategic advantages. This has caused for major distress in some nations and needs to be addressed.

To make the committee more engaging, this year we have modified the committee to include a more varied group of countries. Delegates are expected to adapt to the committee and will be judged on their capacity to lobby, their content and their proposed solutions. They are expected to research extensively and provide detailed and concrete solutions that are pragmatic and can be implemented in real life.

Finally, I hope to see you all at DSMUN in August and hope that along with having a memorable MUN experience, you also enjoy your stay at Chandbagh!

Warm Regards,<br>
Devang Laddha
