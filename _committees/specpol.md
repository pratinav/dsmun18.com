Greetings Delegates!

It’s a pleasure to have you at the Special Political and Decolonization Committee at DSMUN 2018.

This year, we have designed the committee to engage your collaborative and diplomatic skills and, of course, test your oratory skills and intellect. While eloquence and a speaking flair will be required, comprehensive knowledge of the agendas and appropriate documentation are essential. Lobbying skills will be monitored closely since diplomacy is not just restricted to your speeches; therefore, you are encouraged to interact with your co-delegates, more so with the ones from your bloc! I expect you to offer your views with conviction, strictly abide by your country’s foreign policy, and exercise your lobbying skills thoroughly.

On that note, we have selected the following agendas:

- Resolution to the South Sudan Civil War and
- Deliberation upon the Falkland Islands Sovereignty Dispute as our agendas.

The first agenda presents an extremely precarious situation- a parallel can be drawn with the Rwandan genocide and you are encouraged to refer to it while deliberating, discussing and offering solutions to the conflict and the ethnic cleansing claims.

The second agenda brings into play one of the most widely discussed issues in the Decolonization Committee: self-determination. Since the majority of territorial claims to the Falkland Islands are based on events in the 19th and 20th centuries, you must be well-versed with the history of the Islands. You will be expected to compare and contrast the various aspects of self-determination, as presented by the vested interests of your country, and offer a cohesive argument based on your country’s stance.

Lastly, on myself, I am pursuing the IB curriculum in my final year at school. I am an avid reader of Economics and a great fan of Malcolm Gladwell’s work. My interest in contemporary politics has developed over the years, and I take great interest in debates on economic policy. I am the Editor of a couple of School-based publications along with being a member of the Hindi debating Team. Model UN has always intrigued me, and I have been ‘MUNning’ for 3 years now stretching back to Cathedral MUN 2016. I am also a national level swimmer and a cricket enthusiast. Whatever time is spared by IB is used by me in indulging in my guilty pleasures of obsessively following Game of Thrones and binge-eating the unhealthiest of foods. Feel free to strike up a conversation on either!

Looking forward to seeing you at the conference and working together!

Regards,<br>
Shiven Dewan
