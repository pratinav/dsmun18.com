Greetings Delegates!

It’s a pleasure to have you at the Special Political and Decolonization Committee at DSMUN 2018.

This year, we have designed the committee to engage your collaborative and diplomatic skills and, of course, test your oratory skills and intellect. While eloquence and speaking flair will be required, comprehensive knowledge of the agendas and appropriate documentation are essential. Lobbying skills will be monitored closely since diplomacy is not just restricted to your speeches; therefore, you are encouraged to interact with your co-delegates. More so with the ones from your bloc! I expect you to offer your views with conviction, strictly abide by your country’s foreign policy and exercise your lobbying skills thoroughly.

On that note, we have selected

- Resolution to the South Sudan Civil War as our agenda and
    - Establishing a framework for immediate cessation of hostility,
    - Setting up an ideal form of government and laying the groundwork for a constitution as our sub agendas.

The South Sudan Civil War has been raging for a while and ceasefires have been difficult to implement. A parallel can be drawn with the Rwandan genocide and you are encouraged to refer to it while deliberating, discussing and offering solutions to the conflict and the ethnic cleansing claims.

You are encouraged to fall back on conflict resolution models implemented in the past to ingeniously implement a model that would be successful in South Sudan. These models may either be your own or may have some aspects borrowed from the ones in the Background Guide. After the cessation of hostility, you must then work towards the formation of an ideal form of government conducive to South Sudan’s turbulent political and economic environment. Along with this, the government must also lay out the framework for the writing of a constitution that adheres to South Sudan’s rich ethnic diversity. However, I must add here that this is just a mere direction I would like the committee to take. Various other topics pertaining to the conflict may be discussed and debated!

Lastly, on myself, I am pursuing the IB curriculum in my final year at school. I am an avid reader of economics and a great fan of Malcolm Gladwell’s work. My interest in contemporary politics has developed over the years, and I take great interest in debates on economic policy. I am the Editor of a couple of School based publications along with being an avid Debater. Model UN has always intrigued me, and I have been ‘MUNning’ for 3 years now stretching back to Cathedral MUN 2016. I am also a national level swimmer and a cricket enthusiast. Whatever time IB spares, I indulge in my guilty pleasures of obsessively following Game of Thrones and binge eating the unhealthiest of foods. Feel free to strike up a conversation on either!

Looking forward to seeing you at the conference and, more significantly, working together!

Warm Regards,<br>
Shiven Dewan
