Greetings Delegates,
It is an absolute privilege to welcome you to the 12th edition of the DSMUN. This year, I would be serving in the capacity of the Chairperson of the Human Rights Council. I am currently studying in the ISC humanities stream and, expectedly, my key interests lie in politics and history. I have taken part in a number of MUNs over the past years, such as MCGSMUN and PWSMUN.

As for the committee, The Human Rights Council was created by the United Nations General Assembly on the 15th of March, 2006 by adopting resolution (A/RES/60/251). The council works closely with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and is solely responsible for the protection and promotion of all rights placed upon an individual by the Charter of the United Nations and other international human rights laws and treaties.

As the Chairperson, I expect a good amount of debate substantiated with well-grounded facts. Human Rights are derived from deep fundamental concepts, such as individual autonomy, and form an essential crux of our society. It is vital for all delegates to understand their importance, not only for committee, but as an indispensable learning for life. These rights are in a perilous state across the world, and I hope all delegates will understand the gravity of the situation.

Finally, I also expect the delegates to be well researched and have an in depth understanding of the different moral, political and ethical aspects surrounding the agenda. I look forward to the committee and hope to see you all at Chandbagh.

Warm Regards,<br>
Ratnadityasinh Chavda
