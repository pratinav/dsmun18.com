Guten Tag!

My name is Yash Dewan, and I will be presiding over the cabinet meeting of the Third Reich at DSMUN’ 18. I am in class 12 and am currently occupied in ‘fighting back’ the IBDP curriculum. I really enjoy MUN-ing and have participated in several MUNs such as Yale MUN and MCGSMUN.

I am an avid debater and I love the activity for its delicate balance of rhetoric and argumentation, something which I will be looking forward to seeing in committee. Debating has also instilled a deep love for reading in me and I enjoy reading authors ranging from Toni Morrison to Jean Dreze. Social work is also something which I am passionate about and something that forms a huge part of my life.

The Third Reich is a Historical Constant Crisis Committee (HCCC) which will challenge, surprise and captivate the delegates who dare to be a part of it. The delegates who opt in must be prepared for anything ranging from assassination attempts to military strikes and economic crises. Having been a Deputy Chairperson in the United States National Security Council [another CCC] last year, I couldn’t resist taking on the role of Chairperson this year in what I believe is going to be a much more exciting ride.

As for committee, I expect delegates to understand that research is paramount, and they must be well versed with the historical backdrop of Nazi Germany and the Second World War, as all crises will be set in this period. I would suggest that the delegates know the other portfolios as well, in addition to their own, as certain actions are exclusive to particular members of the cabinet. Finally, I expect delegates to give the background guide a thorough read and think and act in accordance to the dynamism of the committee. It would be great to see you collaborate to annex the Great Britain, which is the agenda for this year.

And so may the Reich live a thousand years! Heil!
