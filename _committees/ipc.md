Dear Delegates,

It is indeed a great responsibility that the International Press Corps holds in our cracked world. We stand on the brink of completely shattering all we have known, and every passing day only deepens a rift that must be bridged. The Press, as the world has begun to realise, holds the power to alter our current course; yet, ironically, it is guided by the skewed moralities of ineffective World Leaders.

The International Press Corps this year hopes to cultivate honest and qualitative journalism, with the sole aim to fostering truth and equality. The underlying theme, keeping in mind the proclamations of POTUS Trump, will be battling the notion of ‘fake news’. We shall be drawing the line between tabloid journalism and investigative stories. It will be our responsibility to challenge the leaders of the world and shape the perceptions of the people in it.

As Chairperson of The International Press Corps, I hope to not only mentally engage each delegate, but also teach delegates the intricacies of writing, including the efficacy of writing styles and the importance of how the story is told. To that end, we will be adding a visual element in way of photographic journalism, in addition to the more conventional styles. All you need to do is to bring your ideas and ideologies, and we will work to bring them to fruition. Assisting me in this job will be Suyash Chandak and Pratham Bansal, both students in Class 11 pursuing the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (a common bane to all of our lives).

On a much lighter note, no MUN experience would be complete without a degree of relationship building. For starters, I find myself right at home in a Press Committee, with many years of in-house publications under my belt. I have worked as the Chief Editor of a publication dedicated to Popular Culture. I am also currently the Editor-in-Chief of The Doon School Weekly, the School’s flagship publication. Besides the editorial side of things, I have worked extensively with design and publishing. Of course, this means that MUN and Debates haven’t been too far away, with over five MUNs (including Yale Model United Nations, New Haven) worth of experience. To cherry-top the icing on the cake, I also love cooking and traveling.

Together, let us do what the Press was intended to do. In the search of truth, let us be prepared to fight the hard fight, and though we may often come back empty-handed, we must ford on nonetheless.

See you at DSMUN ’18!

Regards,<br>
Kushagra Kar<br>
Chairperson of the International Press Corps
