Dear Delegates,

I am truly honored to be your chair in this year’s UN Economic and Social Council. I am currently in Class 12 and am pursuing the IB Diploma Programme. I have been an avid MUNner since class 9 and have participated in a numerous MUNs such as the Yale MUN in Connecticut, La Martiniere Girls MUN in Lucknow and the Mayo College Girls MUN. I have also been a Deputy Chairperson at DSMUN 2017. 

Apart from participating in MUNs, my interest lies in playing the piano, reading, and playing squash and football. 

As for the committee, besides quality debate and flow, I would like all delegates to have substantial amount of research in the fields of international trade and sustainable development, as they are crucial pillars of any discussion in the ECOSOC. I would also like to emphasize on the ability to negotiate and garner credibility from other delegates in committee, as it is only through negotiation that we reach a peaceful solution. 

Finally, ECOSOC has the foremost principle of Sustainable development and social progression and hence, it is vital that delegates keep this in mind while discussing either of the agendas. I wish you all the very best in your endeavors while in committee, and hope that we come to a peaceful conclusion at the end of it.

Best Wishes,<br>
Pritish Dugar
