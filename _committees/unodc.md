The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime was established in 1997 through a merger between the United Nations Drug Control Programme, and the Centre for International Crime Prevention, and has since remained an integral body of the United Nations. It deals with various drug related conflicts such as cartels, legalisation, smuggling and even doping. We feel that this committee is of a particularly relevant nature, in light of the huge impact it currently has on the socio-economic structures of nations across the world.

I have been actively participating in MUNs in and around the country for years now, securing awards at numerous national MUNs. My other interests and hobbies lie in music, theatre and debating. I will be assisted in organizing, moderating and judging the committee by my two capable deputy chairpersons: Samarth Mehra and Shreyash Banka. The two agendas that will be discussed in the committee this year are:

- Discussing the legibility and methods of global decriminalisation of Cannabis.

- Discussing and resolving the drug war in Philippines.

This year, the committee will be looking for a productive, healthy and lively debate on the two highly contentious issues. Delegates are encouraged to research well on the provided agendas and provide legitimate, effective, and relevant solutions. Creativity and originality are two important criteria that delegates will be assessed on, along with their rhetoric skills, critical thinking, diplomacy and analysis. We are looking forward to three days of fiery discussion, and will endeavour to make the committee an exciting experience for all.
