Greetings Delegates!

It is both an honor and a privilege to welcome you all to the 12th Doon School Model United Nations Conference, 2018. My name is Rajveer Singh Kochar and I would be your chairperson for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) committee. I have been involved in the DSMUN in various capacities, including being deputy chairperson last year. Apart from MUNing, I have been involved in various other activities like music, debating, and chess. I am currently in the 12th grade, pursuing the IBDP curriculum, and am deeply interested in politics and international economics.

The IAEA was established as an autonomous organization on 29, July 1957, and seeks to “promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and to inhibit its use for any military purpose, including nuclear weapons”. As far as the committee is concerned, I expect all delegates to be thorough with the respective agendas, in order to engage in substantial debate and discussion. Moreover, my primary aim would be to challenge your endurance and your solution-forming abilities, when you are constantly ‘bombarded’ with a wide range of crises.

Both issues are extremely pertinent in the international arena, and I would again stress on the delegates being fully aware of their respective country stances and their roles in shaping up volatile situations on a global scale.

Finally, I wish you the very best of luck and hope to see you all geared-up for action this August at Chandbagh!

Warm Regards,<br>
Rajveer Singh Kochar
