  <h1>About DSMUN</h1>

  <p>The Doon School Model United Nations Conference is one of India’s biggest, and well reputed, high school MUN conferences. Since its inauguration in 2007, The Doon School Model United Nations Society has hosted an engaging, entertaining and intellectually stimulating conference annually, with each leaving behind a unique legacy. DSMUN has grown to be one of the key entries in every school’s MUNning calendar. DSMUN has a history of attracting the best of, both, the Indian and the international delegates from the Pan-Asiatic Region. With each passing year, DSMUN has evolved and developed its programme, introducing new committees, creating singular crises situations and setting unorthodox agendas to challenge the delegates.</p>

  <p>The Doon School, one of India’s most reputed and prestigious institutions, is a member of the G20 Group of Schools, The Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, The International Boys’ Schools Coalition and the Round Square Conference. With its motto, “Knowledge Our Light”, the School aims to mold its students into gentlemen of service and leaders for the future. Model United Nations is one of the largest and most popular activities in School with over 200 students involved in it. The beautiful and serene 69 acre Chandbagh Estate, in which the school campus is set, and its heritage buildings, provide a scenic venue for the conference, ensuring that it will be an experience unlike any other MUN.</p>

  <p>The DSMUN Secretariat is proud to host The 12th Doon School Model United Nations Conference from the 17th to the 19th of August, 2018. Popularly referred to as DSMUN ’18, this year’s conference intends to engage the delegates in 12 diverse committees, each of which will generate discussion on various contemporary and thought-provoking issues. There is also the promise of an opportunity to make new friends and create lifelong memories.</p>

  <p>We look forward to seeing you in Dehra Dun in August!</p>

  <p>Crises to keep you on your toes, unforgettable memories, interesting new people to meet and an experience worth a lifetime! DSMUN ’18 will have it all.</p>
