# Deputy Secretary General's Address

As the Deputy Secretary General, it is my honour and privilege to welcome you all to the 12th Doon School Model United Nations Conference. DSMUN has grown exponentially each year and we hope to build on this legacy with this yearsâ€™s conference.

Our world is now in a phase of transition. With conflicts evolving in nature, political statuses changing radically, and diplomatic alliances restructuring, a new world order is being forged right before us. In times such as these, an activity such as MUN becomes all the more important. Informed, analytical and discerning individuals are the need of the hour, and MUNs greatly help in shaping such individuals.

Over the many editions of DSMUN, we have witnessed many delegates leaving after having deepened their understanding of issues that affect different parts of the world. With 12 committees this year, each with its own unique and pressing agenda, we are certain that each one of you will further develop as global citizens.

On a more personal note, I pursue the IBDP. Having been involved in MUNs for the last four years, I have had the opportunity to serve in various capacities at DSMUN and have attended a number of MUNs in both India and abroad. I have an avid interest in politics and history, and am a voracious reader of the same. I am also the Editor-in-Chief of our school Yearbook and a School Prefect. When not reading, writing or commenting on some political issue, you can find me mountaineering in mountain ranges across the globe.<br>

I look forward to welcoming you all to Chandbagh!<br>

With Warm Regards,

R. Singh
