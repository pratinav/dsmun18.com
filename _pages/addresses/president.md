# President's Address

Dear Delegates,

I am extremely delighted to welcome you all to the 12th edition of the Doon School Model United Nations. Over the stretch of 12 years, DSMUN has earned itself a place among the most eagerly awaited MUNs in the whole of India; this year too, we have spared no effort in meeting these expectations.

With over 12 committees, including the GA committees of DISEC and SPECPOL as well as exciting crisis committees like Board of Control, East India Company, DSMUN promises to engage the delegates in a fierce tussle of rhetoric, negotiation and documentation—areas that have come to occupy an important place in an individual’s holistic development. Further, DSMUN also provides an exciting opportunity for the delegates to meet and make unforgettable memories with people from all over the country!

I currently pursue the ISC curriculum, and after having served in the DSMUN secretariat for 3 years, I am privileged to be at its helm as the President in my last year in School. As the world continues to shrink to an even smaller place, the problems that torment humanity continue to expand. Time, therefore, warrants us to step up and collectively lead the human race to a better tomorrow. And to initiate this, we must begin from a young age itself.<br>

Looking forward to meeting you in August,

Ritwik Saraf
