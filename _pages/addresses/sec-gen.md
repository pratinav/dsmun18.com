# Secretary General's Address

Dear Delegates,

It is an absolute privilege and honour for me to welcome you all to the 12th edition of The Doon School Model United Nations. What was once a small regional event has evolved and grown into an international conference with a repute and prestige that extends across borders. This year, we aim to raise the bar higher with an invigorating mix of structured GA committees like the DISEC and Security Council to dynamic crisis committees like The Third Reich.

I am a veteran of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme, and take a keen interest in geopolitical developments across the world. I am extremely passionate about photography, and am the Editor-in-Chief of The Yearbook, which is one of the premier publications of our school. I have been involved for a considerable time in the MUNning world, and apart from winning multiple accolades, was the Vice-President of last yearâ€™s conference. In a world that is becoming increasingly divisive and polarized, it is vital that we realise the special importance diplomacy and the simple willingness to hear each other out holds. Each committee is uniquely placed at a time and place to make a difference, but only if we approach each negotiation with peace as the goal will our time here be fruitful. I eagerly await your presence at Chandbagh.<br>


Warm Regards,

Ojas Kharabanda
