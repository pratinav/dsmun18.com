## Notice to Delegates

Dear Delegates and Faculty Advisors,

With just about a week left for the conference, we hope this finds you in the best of spirits and all set for DSMUN 2018.

For your convenience and reference, we are putting down some important information.

ARRIVAL AND RECEPTION: All out-station delegations will be received by us at the Railway Station/Airport/Bus Station and transported to their hotels. The boys do not carry mobile phones but will be waiting for you at the platform/Arrivals in their School Uniform. (They’ll be the smart looking chaps in the Doon School white and blue!)

- We will send a separate e mail with the Hotel allocations for the various schools.

We will be picking up and dropping all delegates from the hotels to the School (and vice versa) on all three days of the Conference.

LOCAL SCHOOL REGISTRATIONS: Registration for all Schools from Dehra Dun and Mussoorie will happen on DAY 1, 17th of August between 9:00 and 9:30 am in the Porch of the Kilachand Library.

1. WEATHER CONDITIONS: You’re aware that we will be in the grips of heavy monsoons during the time of the Conference. Heavy showers are expected on all three days. We strongly urge you to carry umbrellas/raincoats with you!

2. FOOTWEAR: Most of the paths at The Doon School are made of "bajri", i.e. pebbles and gravel. The campus, while very beautiful is also rather large- which means a lot of walking! Walking around wearing heels would be very painful and an altogether different kind of Human Rights abuse! We would recommend that you wear appropriate footwear.

3. IT POLICY: We understand that carrying all your research in terms of hard copy is both a waste of paper and money; and uncomfortable to carry. To this end, delegates would be allowed to carry laptops and use them during committee, with the following guidelines in mind.

- Internet access will be available at all points on the campus.
- The username and password would be provided on your arrival here.
- Please note that delegates are only allowed to access the internet during breaks and unmoderated caucuses.
- No delegate is allowed to use the internet during formal debate.
- They can access their research which they have saved from before the conference.
- Failing to keep up with these guidelines would result in the entire delegation being for the Best Delegation Trophy.

4. DELEGATE DINNER AND SOCIAL ON SATURDAY, 18TH OF AUG: As in the previous years, there will be a delegate dinner and Social on Saturday. Students may wish to carry 'appropriate' clothes for this.

The Delegate Dinner and Dance will commence at 7:15 pm. Hence, on Saturday (Day 2), committees will wrap up at 4:30 pm, post which out—station delegates will be dropped back to their Hotels for freshening up and change. They will then be brought back to School at 7:00 pm.

Local Schools may wish to go back. In case that is inconvenient/impractical, appropriate arrangements will be made in School for rest and change of clothes.

5. DRESS CODE: WE STRONGLY REITERATE OUR DRESS CODE POLICY. Please do keep in mind that you are participating in an INTER SCHOOL MUN Conference. While we do not want to sound like some sort of moral police, we request you to respect the sensibilities of The Doon School and dress appropriately. We would be most grateful if the following dress codes could be adhered to (school uniforms are also perfectly acceptable):

  - DAY 1: Opening Ceremony/Committee Sessions/: Western/Indian Formal Wear

  - DAY 2: Committee Sessions: Western/Indian Formal Wear
  Delegate Dance: Informal/Casual Wear

  - DAY 3: Committee Sessions/Closing Ceremony and Grand Dinner: Western Formal Wear.

6. GENERAL ASSEMBLY CRISIS SITUATION: The major bulk of the third day is a joint General Assembly Crisis Situation.

7. POSITION PAPERS: All delegates who have not submitted their position papers are requested to submit it as soon as possible as they will be marked down as they delay it more.

Looking forward to seeing you all at DSMUN 18!

Facebook Groups have been set up for each of the twelve committees. Delegates are requested to check the DSMUN Facebook page for them, and join them as committee related information will be shared on these groups from now onwards.

Warm Regards,

Mohit Sinha
