<p>Greetings!</p>

<p>It gives us great pleasure to welcome you all to the 11th Doon School Model United Nations Conference. Over the years, DSMUN has grown into one of the finest and most reputed high school MUN conferences in the country. This year too we hope to deliver the goods and make this year’s session an unforgettable one. With agendas ranging from religious turmoil in the Middle East to the manhunt for Edward Snowden and Julian Assange, this year’s simulations promise to be exciting, engaging and challenging.</p>

<p>I am a Humanities student and have a keen interest in Economics and History. Besides being a MUNner, I am a passionate theatre person and public speaker. I also have an interest in cricket and boxing.</p>

<p>I have served DSMUN in various capacities ranging from the Secretariat to being a delegate and eventually the Vice-president. DSMUN is an activity which has been very important to me during my school life and this time I am excited to head this very significant event.</p>

<p>I am indeed honoured to be working with such an accomplished and hard-working team on the Executive Board and look forward to a memorable time this fall!</p>

<p>Warm Regards,</p>

<p>Divij Mullick</p>

  <p>Greetings</p>
  <p>It is an honour and privilege to welcome all of you to the 11th Doon School Model United Nations Conference. Over the years, DSMUN has grown to be one of the most prestigious and competitive high school conferences in the country, and we hope that this year’s conference will be a bigger success. With fourteen different committees ranging from the All India Political Parties Meet to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, we have strived to design an exciting and engaging conference for participating delegates.</p>

  <p>I have been involved in DSMUN for the past 5 years in various capacities including Media and the Secretariat. I have an avid interest in history, politics and international affairs and wish to pursue international relations in college. I am also a passionate hockey player and the Editor-in Chief of The Doon School Yearbook.</p>

  <p>This year, Divij and I hope to make this conference a successful and a truly memorable experience for one and all.</p>

  <p>Looking forward to meet all of you at Chandbagh this August!</p>

  <p>Warm Regards,</p>

  <p>Deep Dhandhania</p>
